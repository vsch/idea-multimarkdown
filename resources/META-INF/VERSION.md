  highlighted as unresolved if they have an error 
                            
### 1.4.3 - Bug Fix & Improvements Release

#### Basic & Enhanced Editions

- Fix: license fetch dialog message box font too small on Windows with 
  retina resolution display 
- Fix: #149, Out of memory errors possibly caused by parser throwing an 
  exception during indexing 
- Change: vcs roots are now obtained from the IDE and not by scanning 
  for git configuration in the file system. So if the VCS root is not 
  defined in the IDE the plugin will not be able to resolve links for 
  that GitHub repository. 

#### Enhanced Edition
                            
* Fix: #143, In wiki link completions file names that contain `#` are 
  truncated with `#` in the file treated as an anchor ref 
* Fix: #144, Annotation for wiki links with `#` in filename not shown 
* Fix: #145, Wiki link refactoring not working for file names containing 
  `#` 
* Fix: #146, File names that contain # do not show link references with 
  URL encoded link address. 
* Add: #147, GitHub issue # completions in plain text and for links. In 
  text after `#`, for links after `/issues/`, the cursor must be after a 
  valid issues link for the current file's github repository and come 
  after the last `/`. 

    **NOTE:** For this to work correctly you need to enable "ATX Header 
    Space" option in the parser otherwise a `#` followed by non-space 
    text is parsed as a header and not a github issue. 
* Add: link completions now display shortened file path in completion 
  list. The addressing format is controllable via multiple invocations 
  of the completion popup. If the link does not start with a protocol 
  prefix nor a `/` for repo relative addressing then pressing ctrl+space 
  will cycle through all possible formats configured in preferences 
  under Completions, by default: relative addressing, `/` repo relative, 
  `https://` absolute. With `file://` addressing completions only if the 
  link starts with `file://` before pressing ctrl+space or by changing 
  preferences to include file:// protocol in completion format cycle. 
* Add: code folding for multi-line image urls 
* Add: collapsed by default config under settings **Editor** > 
  **General** > **Code Folding**, for: 
    * verbatim blocks
    * code fence blocks
    * multi-line URL images
    * references
    * explicit links
    * explicit image links
* Fix: ANCHORLINKS parser option only affects unmodified HTML text 
  preview and should not be changed by parser profile changes. 
* Fix: unmodified HTML text preview should not generate header tag ids 
  if ANCHORLINKS parser option is not selected. 
* Fix: multi-line url images with `http://gravizo?` 
    * prefix were adding `;` after `{` 
    * all trailing `;` are removed, not just one when editing injected 
      code fragment 
* Add: view document on GitHub option when file is under vcs and is not 
  modified. No checking is done if changes were actually pushed to the 
  remote branch. 
* Change: color attributes that previously contained `BOLDITALIC` are 
  now `BOLD_ITALIC` to match the naming convention of other attributes. 
* Change: page relative and repo relative links in preview resolve to 
  file in current remote branch with fallback to `master` if current 
  branch has no remote counterpart. Previously they always resolved to 
  `master`. 

### 1.4.2 - Bug Fix & Improvements Release

#### Basic & Enhanced Editions

- Fix: disable spell checker on reference anchors
- Fix: mitigate pegdown parser timeouts by treating the whole text as 
  error with preview showing the pegdown exception with some information 
  on the location where it gave up. 
- Fix: #142, reduced max timeout to 1000 ms, and default to 100ms. No 
  point in longer timeouts, just harder to edit the text to eliminate 
  the error. 
- Fix: removed native thread creation in preview tabs, should be the 
  last of the leftover old code. 

#### Enhanced Edition
                            
* Fix: #138, reference with title refactoring causes exception due to 
  single quote use for title instead of double quote 
* Add: #139, completions for reference and footnote id will show all 
  unresolved corresponding referencing ids in the file 
* Add: #140, under some conditions unresolved links would not be 
  highlighted as such 
* Change: for image alt text completion remove subdirectories matching: 
  "image", "images", "img" and "imgs" from parts used to make 
  suggestions 
* Change: for all link text/title suggestions remove subdirectory parts 
  which match file target GitHub links: blob, raw, wiki from directory 
  parts before generating suggestion 
* Fix: language fragment editor would not be resizeable if more than one 
  split editor is open with JavaFx preview enabled. 
* Change: previous releases did not reset show preview tab when the 
  license was activated for the first time, resulting in many people 
  having preview tab shown by default and not noticing it. This version 
  does a one time reset of this setting. If you really want a preview 
  tab with split editor then just set it again in preferences to have it 
  shown. Only affects files opened after the setting is changed. So you 
  may need to reopen files already opened when you change this setting. 
* New: implement file move refactoring for contained links. If the 
  contained wiki links will no longer reach their targets they are 
  changed to explicit links. 
* Fix: refactoring of links to wiki pages, from files nested below root 
  directory would leave the physical wiki home directory instead of 
  changing it to `wiki` as required to resolve on GitHub. 
* Fix: refactoring explicit to wiki link would leave the markdown 
  extension in the wiki. Extensions are now left only if target is not a 
  markdown file. 
* New: raw/blob preservation across wiki/main repo boundary during file 
  move. Best attempt is made to preserve raw file access of original 
  link 
* New: intention actions implemented instead of annotation quick fixes. 
  Same functionality but no unnecessary weak warnings just to have the 
  quick fix showing and now they can be disabled individually if you 
  don't need them.

* Change: link completions improved for subdirectories: any path 
  segments given will need to be found in the path of the file: sub/ 
  will find files that are in a directory that contains "sub" in its

  "sub" in its name, followed by a subdirectory that has "abc" in its 
  name. File name for completions is ignored.
